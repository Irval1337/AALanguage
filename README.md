## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.ibb.co/mv86vVN/Screenshot-2.png)

There are many interpreted programming languages, but for the faint of heart, this is one! AALanguage is the best choice for people with developmental disabilities. It offers one-of-a-kind functionality and ease of use of basic features.

Here's why you should choose AALanguage:

* User-friendly syntax, similar to C++. It is intuitive to any programmer with retardation.
* Possibility to connect AALanguage libraries by including them in the standard set.
* Presence of a built-in data type for long arithmetic.
* A library with some math functions has already been added to the language, as well as a set of simple algorithms for strings.
* Built-in data type converter. Even a scoof can handle it.
* Some built-in functions working out of the box, for example: random number generator, time counter in milliseconds.

Of course, you won't be able to write any program with AALanguage, but this language will help to brighten your retarded life. Try this interpreted programming language right now to feel the stupidity of its authors.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

## Built With

* [С++ 20 STL](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/)
* [Formal grammars and languages. Elements of translation theory](https://al.cs.msu.ru/files/formal.languages.translation.theory.pdf)

## Getting Started

To use AALanguage's features, copy the interpreter source code and run it, specifying the path to the target .aa script.

### Prerequisites

Install Visual Studio 2022 with the package v143: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ru/downloads/.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Irval1337/AALanguage.git
```
2. Remove the `TESTING_MODE` define if you wish to interpret AALanguage scripts by specifying the library path and directory each time.
3. Set `path` and `lib_path` if there is a `TESTING_MODE` define:
   * `path` - Path to the script file.
   * `lib_path` - A directory with built-in libraries. Each must have the .aa format.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Irval1337/AALanguage/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
